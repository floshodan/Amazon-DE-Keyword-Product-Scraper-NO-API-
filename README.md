# Amazon-DE-Keyword-Product-Scraper-NO-API-
Scrapes Amazon Marketplace by specific keywords by using Selenium. The Script connects to a MySQL Database, fetches keywords from the database and scrapes Amazon. This can be more effortless be done with the official Amazon API. However as of the end of January 2019, Amazon only allows API requests for accounts that actually make sales. That's why I came up with a simple Python script to collect the data needed. 

NOTE! Officially against Amazon TOS.
